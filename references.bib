  abstract = {Drones in many applications need the ability to fly fully or partially autonomously to accomplish their mission. To allow these fully/partially autonomous flights, first, the drone needs to be able to locate itself constantly. Then, the navigation command signal would be generated and passed on to the controller unit of the drone. In this article, we propose a localization scheme for drones called robust localization for indoor navigation of drones with optimized beacon placement (iDROP) that is specifically devised for GPS-denied environments (e.g., indoor spaces). Instead of GPS signals, iDROP relies on speaker-generated ultrasonic acoustic signals to enable a drone to estimate its location. In general, localization error is caused by two factors: the ranging error and the error induced by relative geometry between the transmitters and the receiver. iDROP mitigates these two types of errors and provides a high-precision 3-D localization scheme for drones. iDROP employs a waveform that is robust against multipath fading. Moreover, placing beacons in optimal locations reduces the localization error induced by the relative geometry between the transmitters and the receiver.},

To fully exploit the potential of location awareness and enable new advanced location-based services, localization algorithms need to be combined with complementary technologies including accurate height estimation, i.e., three dimensional location, reliable user mobility classification, and efficient indoor mapping solutions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of such enabling technologies. In particular, we present cellular localization systems including recent results on 5G localization, and solutions based on wireless local area networks, highlighting those that are capable of computing 3D location in multi-floor indoor environments. We overview range-free localization schemes, which have been traditionally explored in wireless sensor networks and are nowadays gaining attention for several envisioned Internet of Things applications. We also present user mobility estimation techniques, particularly those applicable in cellular networks, that can improve localization and tracking accuracy. Regarding the mapping of physical space inside buildings for aiding tracking and navigation applications, we study recent advances and focus on smartphone-based indoor simultaneous localization and mapping approaches.

This method uses an online joint-detection-and-tracking pipeline based on the encoder-decoder mechanism. The complex and multi-step components in the previous method are simplified. Further, it is a new structure based on Transformer. Object query detects the object in the current frame. The object feature query in the previous frame associates these current objects with the previous object. We proposed a method that can be well applied to small targets such as UAVs, achieved 64.1\% MOTA competition on the MOT15 challenge dataset.},

  abstract = {Underwater target localization using range-only and single-beacon (ROSB) techniques with autonomous vehicles has been used recently to improve the limitations of more complex methods, such as long baseline and ultra-short baseline systems. Nonetheless, in ROSB target localization methods, the trajectory of the tracking vehicle near the localized target plays an important role in obtaining the best accuracy of the predicted target position. Here, we investigate a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to find the optimal path that an autonomous vehicle should follow in order to increase and optimize the overall accuracy of the predicted target localization, while reducing time and power consumption. To accomplish this objective, different experimental tests have been designed using state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms. Our study also compares the results obtained with the analytical Fisher information matrix approach used in previous studies. The results revealed that the policy learned by the RL agent outperforms trajectories based on these analytical solutions, e.g. the median predicted error at the beginning of the target's localisation is 17\% less. These findings suggest that using deep RL for localizing acoustic targets could be successfully applied to in-water applications that include tracking of acoustically tagged marine animals by autonomous underwater vehicles. This is envisioned as a first necessary step to validate the use of RL to tackle such problems, which could be used later on in a more complex scenarios.},

  abstract = {Robotics is one of the most emerging technologies today, and are used in a variety of applications, ranging from complex rocket technology to monitoring of crops in agriculture. Robots can be exceptionally useful in a smart hospital environment provided that they are equipped with improved vision capabilities for detection and avoidance of obstacles present in their path, thus allowing robots to perform their tasks without any disturbance. In the particular case of Autonomous Nursing Robots, major essential issues are effective robot path planning for the delivery of medicines to patients, measuring the patient body parameters through sensors, interacting with and informing the patient, by means of voice-based modules, about the doctors visiting schedule, his/her body parameter details, etc. This paper presents an approach of a complete Autonomous Nursing Robot which supports all the aforementioned tasks.~In this paper, we present a new Autonomous Nursing Robot system capable of operating in a smart hospital environment area. The objective of the system is to identify the patient room, perform robot path planning for the delivery of medicines to a patient, and measure the patient body parameters, through a wireless BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacon receiver and the BLE beacon transmitter at the respective patient rooms. Assuming that a wireless beacon is kept at the patient room, the robot follows the beacon's signal, identifies the respective room and delivers the needed medicine to the patient. A new fuzzy controller system which consists of three ultrasonic sensors and one camera is developed to detect the optimal robot path and to avoid the robot collision with stable and moving obstacles. The fuzzy controller effectively detects obstacles in the robot's vicinity and makes proper decisions for avoiding them. The navigation of the robot is implemented on a BLE tag module by using the AOA (Angle of Arrival) method. The robot uses sensors to measure the patient body parameters and updates these data to the hospital patient database system in a private cloud mode. It also makes uses of a Google assistant to interact with the patients.~The robotic system was implemented on the Raspberry Pi using Matlab 2018b. The system performance was evaluated on a PC with an Intel Core i5 processor, while the solar power was used to power the system. Several sensors, namely HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, Logitech HD 720p image sensor, a temperature sensor and a heart rate sensor are used together with a camera to generate datasets for testing the proposed system. In particular, the system was tested on operations taking place in the context of a private hospital in Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. A detailed comparison is performed, through some performance metrics, such as Correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), against the related works of Deepu et al., Huh and Seo, Chinmayi et al., Alli et al., Xu, Ran et al., and Lee et al. The experimental system validation showed that the fuzzy controller achieves very high accuracy in obstacle detection and avoidance, with a very low computational time for taking directional decisions. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated that the robotic system achieves superior accuracy in detecting/avoiding obstacles compared to other systems of similar purposes presented in the related works.},

We present a geometric model of this region based on antenna simulations and data collected with a real system. Our main contribution is a strategy that takes advantage of a UAV's ability to change altitude and exploits a special structure occurring when approaching the target beacon from above to reduce the flight time required to land near the beacon. We analyze the performance of our strategy and demonstrate through simulations that by exploiting this structure we can achieve shorter flight times than our previous work.},

The position of the robot is calculated based on the analysis of the signal strength from these beacons. This strength is determined by a controller installed on the robot through sequential polling of beacons within its visibility range. To enhance the accuracy of the proposed system, a model was developed using experimental data and constructed with a neural network to describe the dependence of the signal strength (RSSI - received signal strength indicator) on the robot's position relative to the beacon. The resulting model is then used in the Levenberg-Marquardt method for optimal estimation of the robot's position. The main advantages of the system include high accuracy, low energy consumption, affordability, and scalability to environments of various configurations.},
